Here is the list of topics I wish Peter could find time to address in his [blog](http://peterberkenbosch.nl/)

1) How to include authentication within a spree extension? (I think it should be included in a broader topic like how to make changes in front & backend)

2) A guide on how to import a full-featured Javascript plugin such as jQuery-fileupload within a spree extention. (Assets management)

3) What are the minimum requirements for a spree-contrib/spree_extension? (Tests, License, i18n, doc...) What should be tested, translated and documented? With, as an underlying topic (title?), how to get the community interested and involved around the extension.

4) How to internationalize the spree urls (if it is not too hard/useless). I mean to have our application display urls like myspree.com/produits ... instead of myspree.com/products (taking i18n maybe too seriously)

... And many more to come...
