Here is the list of topics I wish Peter could find time to address in his [blog](http://peterberkenbosch.nl/)

1) How to include authentication within a spree extension?

2) A guide on how to import a full-featured Javascript plugin such as jQuery-fileupload within a spree extention. (Assets management)

3) What are the minimum requirements for a spree-contrib/spree_extension? (Tests, License, i18n, doc...) What should be tested, translated and documented? With as an underlying topic (title?) how to get the community interested and involved around the extension.

... And many more to come...
