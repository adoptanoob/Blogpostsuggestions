Here is the list of topics I wish Peter could find time to address in his [blog](http://peterberkenbosch.nl/)

1) How to include authentication within a spree extension?

2) A guide on how to import a full-featured Javascript plugin such as jQuery-fileupload within a spree extention. (Assets management)

... And many more to come...
